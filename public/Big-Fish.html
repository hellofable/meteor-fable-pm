          By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp; The Key to the City dangles around his neck.&nbsp; <br>

          He stares at himself in the reflection.&nbsp; He smiles.<br>
          <br>
          It&#39;s then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.&nbsp; No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.&nbsp; We never see her face.<br>
          <br>
          She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.&nbsp; Edward is breathless.&nbsp; It&#39;s the first woman he&#39;s seen in her natural state, and he doesn&#39;t dare move lest he frighten her away.<br>
          <br>
          Then he sees the snake.<br>
          <br>
          It&#39;s a cottonmouth, has to be.&nbsp; It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.&nbsp; There&#39;s no decision to be made.&nbsp; On pure instinct, Edward dives in.&nbsp; He swims as hard as can, <br>
          <br>
          GRABBING THE SNAKE<br>
          <br>
          just as it&#39;s about to strike.<br>

          While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.&nbsp; He never even saw her face.

          Like magic, the dog&#39;s whole demeanor changes.&nbsp; It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch.<br>

          A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet.&nbsp; We have no idea what they&#39;re saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same.<br>
          <br>
          The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he&#39;s finished.&nbsp; The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in.&nbsp; The Emcee makes a &#34;shoot him in the neck&#34; motion to one of the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

          <br>
          But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage.&nbsp; The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins.&nbsp; It&#39;s just enough cover for Edward to remain unseen.<br>
          <br>
          He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage.&nbsp; He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up.&nbsp; Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers.&nbsp; Every one of them would kill him.&nbsp; He&#39;s the legless cricket left on the anthill.

          She stands with her hips turned in profile.&nbsp; Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin.&nbsp; The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.<br>
          <br>
          UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER.&nbsp; The two men begin to SCUFFLE.&nbsp; <br>

          MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song.&nbsp; Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

            Those days, your father was working for himself.&nbsp; If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it&#39;s that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.&nbsp; One night he was returning from three weeks on the road, when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life.
